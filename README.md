# hello-world

This is my first attempt.

This is my initial touch with GitHub. I will use this platform to store up my projects while building up my portfolio.

Though I'm not that good in python programming and programming in whole as well, I'm sure that if I keep doing this things up I will manage to become the next Data Scientist.
